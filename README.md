#My python To-Do app   (VERSION 0.1)

This is a simple To-Do app with a form to add new todos, a list to display exisitng todos, and a delete button to remove todos.

The front-end uses Axios to make erquests to the backend API to retrieve and update todo dada.

Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests. It provides a simple and intuitive way to send requests to servers and handle responses. Axios is typically used in the frontend (client-side) to make requests to the backend (server-side) API.

In the frontend code, I used Axios to make requests to the backend API endpoints, such as:
JavaScript
- axios.get("/todos")
- axios.post("/todos", data)
- axios.put(`/todos/${todoId}`, data)
- axios.delete(`/todos/${todoId}`)


The backend uses the Flask and FlaskAlchemy classes to serve the requests and responses.
Here's a brief overview of the code:
1. It defines a Todo model with id, title, description, and completed fields.
2. It defines five routes:
   - GET /todos: Retrieves a list of all Todo items.
   - POST /todos: Creates a new Todo item.
   - GET /todos/<int:todo_id>: Retrieves a single Todo item by ID.
   - PUT /todos/<int:todo_id>: Updates a single Todo item by ID.
   - DELETE /todos/<int:todo_id>: Deletes a single Todo item by ID.
3. It uses jsonify to return JSON responses.
4. It uses db.create_all() to create the database tables.

This code uses the serialize method to convert the Todo object to a JSON-serializable dictionary. This is necessary because the Todo object contains a db.Column object, which is not JSON-serializable.

Note that this code assumes you have Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy installed. If not, you can install them using pip:
> pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy

Also, this code uses a SQLite database, which is a file-based database. The database file will be created in the same directory as the script.
